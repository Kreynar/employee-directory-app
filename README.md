# The task

![illustration-for-readme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13556960/56870211-bc25e100-6a14-11e9-8137-bf96897dacfb.png)

Use React + Redux for the assignment.

Based on this diagram, the component hierarchy for the Employee Directory app looks like this:

- App

- HomePage

- Header

- SearchBar

- EmployeeList

- EmployeeListItem

- EmployeePage

- Header

- EmployeeDetails

“App” is the application container that will transition pages in and out of the UI.

Every time you click on the list item it should open in a new TAB.

There can be a maximum of 2 TABs opened at a time.

The TAB can be closed using an ‘X’ button on top that you can add.

Each Employee Page TAB would have an editable “title” field and an “UPDATE” button that would update the title in the Employee List as well.

Each Employee Page TAB should maintain its individual state when another TAB is clicked.

Use the JSON data below and attached images with the document.

Feel free to assume and make changes to design if it looks suitable.

# Additional info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
